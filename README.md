Project Goal: Using NBA players data from 1950 to 2017, we would like to present U.S. state heat map of players’ birth state. We would like to determine if there are locations that more frequently produce NBA talent, and if so, where these locations are located. Additionally, we want to analyze the most frequent colleges that produce NBA players using a wordcloud. Finally, we would like to compare player height, weight, field goal percentage, freethrow percentage, and fouls per game with respect to time to understand how the game has changed in the past 67 years.

Data Source: https://www.kaggle.com/drgilermo/nba-players-stats 

Final outputs: 
•	Most frequent player names (BW)
•	Word cloud of where players went to college (AW)
•	U.S. density map of players birth state (AW)
•	Grouped timeseries charts with respect to time (BW)
