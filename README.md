Project Goal: Using NBA players data from 1950 to 2017, we would like to present global density maps of players’ college, birth city, and birth state. We would like to determine if there are locations that more frequently produce NBA talent, and if so, where these locations are located. We would also like to compare this relationship with time to better understand how these trends have shifted. 

Data Source: https://www.kaggle.com/drgilermo/nba-players-stats 

Final outputs: 
•	Global density map and word cloud of where players went to college
•	Global density map and word cloud of players birth city
•	Global density map and word cloud of players birth state
•	Split this analysis up for each decade, to track changes with respect to time
