Names:	Alexander Williamson (Wednesday class)

Project Goal: Using NBA players data from 1950 to 2017, we would like to present global density maps of players’ college, birth city, and birth state. We would like to determine if there are locations that more frequently produce NBA talent, and if so, where these locations are located. We would also like to compare player height with respect to time to understand if player heights have increased in the past 67 years.

Data Source: https://www.kaggle.com/drgilermo/nba-players-stats 

Final outputs: 
•	Word cloud of where players went to college
•	Global density map of players birth city
•	Global density map of players birth state
•	Grouped player boxplot showing height with respect to time
